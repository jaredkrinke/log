title: TEC Redshift disc-dumping tool
description: I couldn't find a tool to dump TEC Redshift discs from Exapunks, so I made one.

Leveraging [someone else's reverse-engineering work](https://rami-sabbagh.com/TEC-Redshift-Disk-Specification/), I made a [browser-based tool for dumping TEC Redshift discs into EXA code and JSON formats](https://jaredkrinke.github.io/tec-redshift-dumper/).

I don't know if anyone else will ever want such a tool, but one now exists, regardless.

# Background
For analytical minds, there's an irresistible genre of games called "zachlikes" (I even [made one](sic-1.md)). The best zachlikes come directly from [Zachtronics](https://www.zachtronics.com/index.html), namely:

* [Opus Magnum](https://www.zachtronics.com/opus-magnum/), the appropriately-named **best zachlike ever made**
* [Exapunks](https://www.zachtronics.com/exapunks), the **best *programming* zachlike** (maybe tied with [TIS-100](https://www.zachtronics.com/tis-100))

**What does this have to do with anything?**

Exapunks is a programming zachlike, and I'm [in dire need of more programming languages](../programming-languages/100-languages.md), so obviously I needed to solve a Project Euler problem in Exapunks. Ok, done. Then I wanted to share my code in a source code-like format and couldn't find an appropriate tool, so I made one.

That's all. End of story.
