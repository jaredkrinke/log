title: Beyond 100 programming languages
description: Here's a bunch of interesting programming languages that I didn't get around to trying out.

While [sampling 100 different programming languages](100-languages.md), I compiled a list of intriguing programming languages. Although I tested out a lot of languages, there are still many I never got around to--not because I didn't think they were promising--sometimes they just didn't match what I wanted at the time or they were too similar to other languages I'd recently used.

If you're looking for inspiration for your own programming language experiments, consider these! I have **bolded** the ones I personally was most interested in.

# Object-oriented
* **[Pharo](https://pharo.org/): being a Smalltalk, it includes an entire IDE**
* [Squirrel](http://www.squirrel-lang.org/): object-oriented scripting language for games
* [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/): Ruby-like compiled language
* [io](https://iolanguage.org/): minimal, pure object-oriented language

# Functional
* [Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)): educational language from the 60s, with turtle graphics
* [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/): Erlang-compatible functional language
* [Koka](https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/index.html): functional language with effect types and handlers
* [Scrapscript](https://scrapscript.org/): sounds kind of like Unison on IPFS?
* **[Gren](https://gren-lang.org/): compiles to JavaScript**
* [EYG](https://eyg.run/): provides a structural editor

# Lisp
* [newLISP](http://www.newlisp.org/): reimagined, batteries-included Lisp
* [Emacs Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs_Lisp): (probably) the world's most popular Lisp (note: not purely functional, as far as I understand)
* [Basilisp](https://basilisp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted.html): Clojure-inspired Lisp that targets Python
* [jank](https://jank-lang.org/): Clojure-inspired language that is compiled via LLVM
* **[Otus Lisp](https://github.com/yuriy-chumak/OL): very small Scheme implementation**
* [Coalton](https://github.com/coalton-lang/coalton): statically-typed Lisp

# Logic programming
* **[Curry](https://www.curry-language.org/): functional logic programming language**

# Assembly
* [CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8): the world's oldest fantasy console?

# Imperative (compiled)
* [Oberon-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberon-2): Pascal-like, possibly with a single-pass compiler?
* [Red](https://www.red-lang.org/): systems-level, but inspired by Rebol
* **[Vale](https://vale.dev/): memory-safe language that is simpler than Rust (but currently incomplete)** -- I really wanted to try this one, but I think the compiler required Java and I didn't have a working Java setup at the time
* [Borgo](https://borgo-lang.github.io/): built on Go, but with a more expressive language
* [Mojo](https://www.modular.com/mojo): Python, but compiled -- note: closed source, as far as I can tell
* [Scopes](https://sr.ht/~duangle/scopes/): another "better C"? -- note: I consider this to be a good thing!
* **[D](https://dlang.org/): C++-alternative with an optional garbage collector (and tons of other features)**
* [MUMPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUMPS): "Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi-Programming System" from the 60s
* [bl](https://github.com/travisdoor/bl): "simple programming language created for fun"
* [Jakt](https://github.com/SerenityOS/jakt): programming language developed as part of the [SerenityOS project](https://serenityos.org/)
* **[SectorC](https://github.com/xorvoid/sectorc): a partial C compiler that (somehow) fits in a 512-byte boot sector**
[Beef](https://www.beeflang.org/): created for game development, includes a full (Windows-only) IDE
* [PL/0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/0): educational programming language by the creator of Pascal
* [FreePascal](https://www.freepascal.org/): modern day Pascal that supports many targets

# Imperative (interpreted)
* [PILOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PILOT): imperative language from the 60s
* [Antimony](https://github.com/antimony-lang/antimony): aims to be simple
* [Elvish](https://elv.sh/): modern shell scripting language
* [Amber](https://amber-lang.com/): compiles to Bash
* **[MiniScript](https://miniscript.org/): a small, new, embeddable scripting language (think: a modern Lua)**

# Concatenative
* [Joy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_(programming_language)): purely functional, but supposedly similar to Forth
* [SectorForth](https://github.com/cesarblum/sectorforth): Forth implementation that bootstraps from a 512-byte boot sector
* [nf](https://github.com/luke8086/nf): minimal interactive programming language

# Data-driven
* [Streem](https://github.com/matz/streem): prototype stream-based programming language
