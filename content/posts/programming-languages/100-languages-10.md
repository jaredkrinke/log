title: 100 programming languages in... more than 100 days
description: I made it about half of the way to my goal of writing code in 100 different programming languages in 100 days.

In March, I set a lofty goal to [solve 100 Project Euler problems using 100 different programming languages, all within 100 days](100-languages.md). Slightly over 100 days later, I'll admit that **I only made it [slightly beyond](100-languages-9.md) [50](50-different-languages.md)**, although that's not too bad considering that I quietly set this project aside a few weeks ago.

**I'm not abandoning this effort, but I am definitely taking a break from it.** And I'm not setting it aside because it isn't fun (though I do wonder if it's [a good use of my time](../misc/my-hobby-is-bikeshedding.md)). At the moment, I just have more important and interesting things to attend to.

# Conquests
For the record, I'd like to state that, so far, **I'm most proud of the following solutions**:

* [SIC-1 Assembly Language](https://github.com/jaredkrinke/100-languages/blob/main/src/p1.sic1), because it was hard to cram into 253 bytes
* [SectorLISP](https://github.com/jaredkrinke/100-languages/blob/main/src/p2.lisp), because I had to implement arithmetic *twice*
* [Verilog](https://github.com/jaredkrinke/100-languages/blob/main/src/p17.v), because hardware
* [EXA](https://github.com/jaredkrinke/100-languages/blob/main/src/p19.exa), because [Exapunks](https://www.zachtronics.com/exapunks/) is a great game
* [x86 boot sector](https://github.com/jaredkrinke/100-languages/blob/main/src/p26.asm), because I didn't want SectorLISP and SectorForth to have all the fun
* [Piet](https://github.com/jaredkrinke/100-languages/blob/main/src/p34-scaled.png), because coding in 2D, using pixels, was hard
* [TypeScript's type system](https://github.com/jaredkrinke/100-languages/blob/main/src/p54.ts), because I wanted to see if it was possible (see [blog post](extreme-typing-in-typescript.md))

# And a few stragglers
With all that said, there are a couple of languages I haven't yet mentioned on here:

## Haxe
* I like the idea of a portable language
* But I didn't like the Java-like levels of ceremonial keywords/classes
* Having said that, I prefer Haxe's familiar syntax and conveniences over something more minimal

## K
* [oK](https://github.com/JohnEarnest/ok) is literally the only version of K I could even find
* oK also only had the only detailed documentation of K that I could find
* I'm compelled to contrast this with [J](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_(programming_language)) (another array language), which is open source and has plenty of documentation

# That's all
That was a short update, but it feels good to tie up those loose ends.
