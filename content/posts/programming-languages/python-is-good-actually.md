Today, I discovered that my [Python is the new BASIC](python-as-a-modern-basic.md) post had been discussed on a popular site. It's always a joy when people take an interest in your work, right? Well...

**In the comments, I was rightly roasted.**

Consider this post an apology and a promise to do better.

(Note: I went back and edited the post in question. This commentary applies to the original content.)

# Problems with my post
First off, **the overall tone of the post crossed the line from criticism to snark--or maybe even scorn**. In my head, some of the jabs were just good-natured ribbing, but upon re-reading from the perspective of an internet stranger, it's just oozing with derision. If I'm going to post something publicly, I should remember that **the audience is not myself, but just anyone who happens to come along** (except AI scrapers, per robots.txt).

Additionally, I didn't clearly articulate my complaints with Python. I think some them are legitimate but, besides being better explained elsewhere, **my issues are not even that relevant**. The things I like about Python outweigh the things I dislike. And **there is a huge advantage to having a common programming language that everyone understands** (even if only the basics). I like keeping posts short, and a good way to do that is to stay on topic and cut out (most of) the snark.

# Not just Python
And it's not just Python. I've also whined about perceived bloat on, ahem, more than one occasion. I've complained about compilers not working on the first try. And so on. **There isn't any value in posting shallow dismissals of projects that took enormous amounts of work to produce**. I'll try to stop doing that. **Even if I can't always make the world better, I can at least try to not make it worse**.

Mea culpa.
