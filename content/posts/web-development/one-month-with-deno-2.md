In [part 1](one-month-with-deno.md), I gushed over Deno's benefits, including sand-boxing, native TypeScript support, a simple module registry, and more. Here's part 2 (which paints a less rosy picture).

# Problems with Deno
Using Deno has come with some significant challenges. Here are the top issues I've faced using Deno for the last month.

## Existing TypeScript modules don't work
## Node packages usually don't work
## Standard library licenses
## Dependency Hell reimagined
## Bundling only emits JavaScript
## Long command lines with no task runner
## The uglifier, er "formatter"
## Bugs, bugs, bugs
