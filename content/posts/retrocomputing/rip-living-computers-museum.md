Given my interest in [old](amiga-day-project-euler.md), [slow](../programming-languages/minimal-dev-env-3.md), and [minimalist](../programming-languages/minimal-dev-env.md) computers, it's unsurprising that I thoroughly enjoyed the [Living Computers Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Computers:_Museum_%2B_Labs). Not only I was able to relive my childhood of playing Marble Madness on a (real) [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64), it was the backdrop to my first experience with the vaunted [Amiga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga) platform. Astoundingly, it was also possible to toy around with ancient room-sized computers of yore.

Back in 2020, I was saddened to hear that the museum had [closed its doors](https://seattlecollegian.com/paul-allens-living-computers-museum-remains-closed-after-years-despite-lifted-covid-restrictions/), after the death of its benefactor, Paul Allen. Generously, they left many machines (and even a BBS) accessible over telnet. **In fact, I had logged into the LCM telnet interface roughly one week ago.**

But recently it all went dark. The Living Computers Museum has [officially shut down for good and its artifacts are to be auctioned off](https://hackaday.com/2024/06/25/paul-allens-living-computers-museum-and-labs-to-be-auctioned/). The telnet service, and even the museum's web site, have all been unceremoniously taken offline. **It's a sad day for vintage computing.**

I guess, for now, I will plan on continuing to run my own vintage hardware museum, however inefficient.
