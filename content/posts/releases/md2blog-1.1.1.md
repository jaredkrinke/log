[md2blog](https://jaredkrinke.github.io/md2blog/) is a zero-config static site generator for dev blogs (like this one), that was created out of frustration with existing (bloated) static site generators.

The [md2blog web site](https://jaredkrinke.github.io/md2blog/) lists the key features, but here's an overview:

1. md2blog enables you to create a dev blog from Markdown files without getting bogged down in extraneous details (like runtime environments, plugins, and themes)
1. md2blog respects your readers by producing a simple (and small) web site that is still fully functional

If you've been disappointed with the complexity of setting up a simple dev blog using other static site generators, I encourage you to download md2blog's *single self-contained binary* and run through the [quick start](https://jaredkrinke.github.io/md2blog/quick-start.html).
