One of the reasons I decided to give [Python](../programming-languages/python.md) one last try is that Python is popular for machine learning, and machine learning is a topic I'm interested in.

# Why?
Why am I interested in machine learning?

* It's an area of computer science that has advanced significantly since I studied CS in school
* It has many unique practical applications (speech recognition, language translation, machine vision, generative art)
* I recently acquired a GPU that (as far as I know) is amenable to accelerating machine learning pipelines

# First steps
As an introduction, I'm following MIT's [Introduction to Machine Learning (2020)](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.036+1T2019/about) class.

I happen to learn best by *doing*, so I'm brainstorming project ideas:

* Train a model to recognize musical notes or chords (probably starting with sine waves, since it's easy to generate examples)
* Train a model to play a simple board game (e.g. tic-tac-toe), and compare the result to a conventional algorithm like [minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax)

So far, that's all I've got, but I have some other resources in mind that may eventually pique my interest:

* Kaggle data sets (e.g. [NBA players](https://www.kaggle.com/vivovinco/nba-player-stats), [Hacker News data](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news), [chord classification](https://www.kaggle.com/deepcontractor/musical-instrument-chord-classification), [movies data](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset), [Stack Overflow data](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/stackoverflow))
