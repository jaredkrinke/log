As [noted previously](getting-started.md), I've been researching machine learning (just for fun).

# MITx - 6.036
I'm starting with an undergraduate course from MIT that is online for free: [MITx - 6.036: Introduction to Machine Learning](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.036+1T2019/about).

Eight weeks into this course, here are some observations:

* The lectures are excellent, but note that they're theory- and math-heavy (and my math was rustier than I realized)
* I'd recommend learning about [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) *prior* to starting this course (especially [element-wise operations and broadcasting](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.broadcasting.html))
* So far, there has been no need (and no benefit) to enabling GPU acceleration (and setting it up on Windows was painful, for [reasons I still don't understand](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/48868))
* The provided code seems to be built for a previous version of TensorFlow's Keras interface (although the [updates I have needed thus far](https://gist.github.com/jaredkrinke/0fed897dfbdf35af2c4eb388bfe0d754) were minor)

So far, I've enjoyed re-learning some math and playing around with classification and regression problems, but I haven't run across anything yet that I'd like to immediately apply to one of my existing projects or use as the basis for a new project.
