I had just been there the previous day, but after receiving an inevitable update, I was returning once again. Inevitable or not, I was never able to imagine it actually happening.

It was one of the few sunny days of an unusually cold spring. I was driving down a mostly empty freeway in the evening. I'd made this drive many times before, but this time was different.

I'm still not sure how to feel about it, and I'm not convinced that there even *is* a way one should feel about it.

Regardless, it puts things into perspective.
