<h1><a href="../../posts/vintage-computing/40-year-old-dev-environment.html">My new 40-year-old development environment</a></h1>

<p>Lately, my computing interests have revolved around the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exploring programming languages (<a href="../programming-languages/50-different-languages.html">50+ so far</a>)</li>
<li>Testing out <a href="../programming-languages/minimal-dev-env.html">minimal development environments</a></li>
<li><a href="../retrocomputing/amiga-day-project-euler.html">Playing with vintage computers</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to some generosity and good luck, I just acquired a &quot;new&quot; computer on which all three interests can converge:</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/c64.jpg" alt="Commodore 64 with monitor"></p>
<p>That&#39;s an original Commodore 64. Also known as <a href="../programming-languages/minimal-dev-env.html#back-in-my-day">the first computer I ever used</a>. It sports a 1 MHz 8-bit CPU and 64 KB of RAM. Aside: despite these outdated specs, <strong>the C64 boots faster than any modern computer</strong>--it&#39;s practically instantaneous.</p>
<p>Given that the C64 is one of the most popular computers of all time (per Guinness), it supports <a href="https://www.lyonlabs.org/commodore/onrequest/collections.html">a multitude of programming languages</a>, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assembly</li>
<li>BASIC</li>
<li>C</li>
<li>COBOL</li>
<li>Forth</li>
<li>FORTRAN</li>
<li>Lisp</li>
<li>Logo</li>
<li>Pascal</li>
<li>Prolog</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#39;s even, apparently, <a href="https://www.lyonlabs.org/commodore/onrequest/nanovm-announce.txt">a 16 KB minimal JVM</a>.</p>
<h1 id="the-plan">The plan</h1>
<p>Obviously, the task at hand is to <strong>solve a few Project Euler problems using a mid-80s development environment</strong>. I&#39;ve <a href="../programming-languages/100-languages-4.html#commodore-basic">already sovled a problem using Commodore BASIC</a> (using an emulator, since I didn&#39;t have a C64 at the time), so next up I&#39;m looking at the following (likely in this order):</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Blazin&#39; Forth</strong>, by Scott Ballantyne (1985)</li>
<li><strong>MicroLisp</strong>, by Nicholas Vrtis (1986)</li>
<li><strong>G-Pascal</strong>, by Nick Gammon (1982)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="blazin-forth">Blazin&#39; Forth</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve actually spent a bit of time tinkering with Blazin&#39; Forth already. So far, it feels like a supremely authentic implementation of Forth. Notably, <strong>Blazin&#39; Forth feels like a self-contained little operating system</strong>--it even implements its own line-based text editor and block-based storage--no file system needed. Note: in the long run, I&#39;m not sure this is a good tradeoff, but from a self-hosting and bootstrapping perspective, it&#39;s nifty (also: did I mention there&#39;s only 64 KB of RAM?).</p>
<p>That&#39;s all I have for now. Until next time!</p>
