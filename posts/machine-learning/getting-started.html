<p>One of the reasons I decided to give <a href="../programming-languages/python.html">Python</a> one last try is that Python is popular for machine learning, and machine learning is a topic I&#39;m interested in.</p>
<h1 id="why">Why?</h1>
<p>Why am I interested in machine learning?</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#39;s an area of computer science that has advanced significantly since I studied CS in school</li>
<li>It has many unique practical applications (speech recognition, language translation, machine vision, generative art)</li>
<li>I recently acquired a GPU that (as far as I know) is capable of accelerating machine learning pipelines</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="first-steps">First steps</h1>
<p>As an introduction, I&#39;m following MIT&#39;s <a href="https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.036+1T2019/about">Introduction to Machine Learning (2020)</a> class. It&#39;s in Python and builds on <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a>. The first 4 weeks focus on linear classifiers for binary classification.</p>
<p>Although my math is rusty, my biggest struggle is actually with the NumPy API. Here is my list of grievances:</p>
<ul>
<li>NumPy implicitly &quot;broadcasts&quot; arrays into compatible shapes<ul>
<li>I assume this is for convenience, but all it&#39;s done for me is silently hide bugs in my code</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>NumPy sometimes silently removes dimensions<ul>
<li>Again, this is probably for convenience, but all it&#39;s done is trip me up -- I really wish <code>keepdims</code> defaulted to <code>True</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The API has a lot of cruft (e.g. a <code>matrix</code> class that is no longer recommended for matrix computation)</li>
<li>The documentation is frustratingly vague, and sometimes circular (e.g. &quot;<code>*</code> returns <code>self * value</code>&quot;)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="using-a-sample-data-set">Using a sample data set</h2>
<p>To get a better handle on NumPy, I&#39;d like to actually attempt to create a linear classifier from scratch. A quick search led me to a <a href="https://jamesmccaffrey.wordpress.com/2018/03/14/datasets-for-binary-classification/">page with links to data sets for binary classification problems</a>. I&#39;m using <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication">UCI Machine Learning Repository&#39;s &quot;banknote authentication&quot; data set</a> because the data format is simple (4 predictor variables and a 0 or 1 for the classification).</p>
<p>To my surprise, simple algorithms (e.g. selecting random parameters) were able to correctly classify over 95% of examples. For what it&#39;s worth, my code is posted <a href="https://github.com/jaredkrinke/ml/tree/main/binary-classification">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="solving-a-problem-from-scratch">Solving a problem from scratch</h2>
<p>I&#39;d like to try solving a real world problem from scratch, but I don&#39;t really have a problem in mind that lends itself to binary classification. For what it&#39;s worth, here are some Kaggle data sets that might eventually inspire me:</p>
