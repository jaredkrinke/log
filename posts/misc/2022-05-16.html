<p>I had just been there the previous day, but after receiving an inevitable update, I was returning once again. Inevitable or not, I was never able to imagine it actually happening.</p>
<p>It was one of the few sunny days of an unusually cold spring. I was driving down a mostly empty freeway in the evening. I&#39;d made this drive many times before, but this time was different.</p>
<p>I&#39;m still not sure how to feel about it, and I&#39;m not convinced that there even <em>is</em> a way one should feel about it.</p>
<p>Regardless, it puts things into perspective.</p>
