<p>As usual, this is probably a terrible idea, but I&#39;ve set a poorly conceived personal goal:</p>
<p><strong>Solve the first 100 problems from <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> <em>using a different programming language for each one</em>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I&#39;ve created a <a href="https://github.com/jaredkrinke/100-languages">repository on GitHub to track my progress</a> and a <a href="../100-languages/index.html">tag index page</a> for related blog posts. And I <a href="100-languages-1.html">just finished day 1</a>.</p>
<h1 id="reasons-this-is-a-dumb-idea">Reasons this is a dumb idea</h1>
<p>If you&#39;re thinking this is a pointless, trivial exercise, you might be right. Here are some reasons that this is likely <em>not</em> a good use of my time:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Many Project Euler problems are more about math than programming</strong>, so I might just end up implementing known mathematical formulas rather than creating and refining algorithms</li>
<li><strong>Solving one small, isolated problem is definitely not sufficient</strong> for <em>really</em> learning a programming language</li>
<li><strong>I might end up spending more time setting up development environments</strong> than actually programming</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m sure I could enumerate many more reasons to <em>not</em> do this.</p>
<h1 id="reasons-this-is-not-a-dumb-idea">Reasons this is <em>not</em> a dumb idea</h1>
<p>Despite this being an obvious waste of time, I&#39;m still &quot;full steam ahead&quot; because:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>There are lots of programming languages I&#39;d like to sample</strong>, and this is a great excuse to finally try them</li>
<li><strong>Each problem is bite-sized</strong>, so I might actually be able to start and finish something in one of my frequent small pockets of free time</li>
<li>It&#39;s such an awful idea, that <strong>I&#39;ll feel zero regret if I abandon the project</strong></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="caveats">Caveats</h1>
<p>I left this section for last, hoping that people wouldn&#39;t make it this far, because the headline is deliberately misleading. <strong>When I mentioned &quot;100 days&quot;, I didn&#39;t mean 100 <em>consecutive</em> days</strong>. And I didn&#39;t even necessarily mean that each programming language would take 1 day. The &quot;100 days&quot; is really more about limiting the amount of collateral damage to my personal life that this project might cause.</p>
<p>On that note, wish me luck! And feel free to <a href="mailto:log@schemescape.com">email me</a> suggestions for programming languages (especially if you know of Project Euler problems to pair with them).</p>
