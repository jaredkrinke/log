<p>I&#39;m <a href="https://log.schemescape.com/posts/programming-languages/100-languages.html">trying to write code in 100 different programming languages</a>. Note: I&#39;m not necessarily planning on blogging about each programming language, but I <em>will</em> try to collect (and share) notes about my experiences, likely in batches.</p>
<h1 id="sic-1-assembly-language">SIC-1 Assembly Language</h1>
<p>In order to ensure progress doesn&#39;t fizzle out immediately, I&#39;m starting with a programming language I know well: <strong><a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/SIC-1_Assembly_Language">SIC-1 Assembly Language</a></strong>. I&#39;m familiar with this language because I designed both it and the (fictional) 8-bit SIC-1 computer it runs on myself (for a game titled, fittingly, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124440/SIC1/">SIC-1</a>). <strong>SIC-1 Assembly Language is basically my take on a usable (though somewhat un-ergonomic) <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Subleq">subleq</a> assembly language</strong>.</p>
<p>I&#39;m mildly familiar with assembly languages, and have written assembly code for MIPS and ATmega (non-professionally), but <strong>most code I write is not performance-sensitive, so I prefer to use more expressive languages</strong>, despite any potential overhead.</p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Subleq is inconvenient, but straight-forward, however <strong>the SIC-1 is an 8-bit computer with only a single 256 byte address space</strong>, yielding space for less than 85 instructions, even before adding in any variables</li>
<li>Fitting &quot;big int&quot; arithmetic, formatting, and the actual logic into roughly 70 &quot;subtract and maybe branch&quot; instructions&quot; required some creativity</li>
<li>The tedium of subleq and my lack of focus led to several bugs, so I had to add a lot of comments to ensure I could remember what all those subleqs were for</li>
<li>I had to invent a subroutine calling convention in order to make my solution &quot;fit&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, <strong>subleq is interesting theoretically</strong> (but not <em>practically</em>), and, while <strong>the tight constraints of the SIC-1 give me an appreciation for assembly language hacks of yore</strong>, I&#39;d never want to use subleq for anything substantial (though I&#39;ve heard <a href="http://users.atw.hu/gerigeri/DawnOS/index.html">it&#39;s been done</a>!).</p>
