<p>In <a href="future-proof-languages.html">a previous article</a>, I enumerated a bunch of popular programming languages and tried to quickly determine which ones seemed like they'd still be useful in another decade.</p>
<p>Now, I'm drilling more deeply into Python.</p>
<h1 id="setting-up-a-python-development-environment">Setting up a Python development environment</h1>
<p>Python is consistently one of the most popular programming languages, but I've mostly avoided it. What am I missing?</p>
<p>While setting up Python, I noticed that typing &quot;python&quot; into my Windows command prompt launches the Microsoft Store app (compliments of <code>%LocalAppData%\Microsoft\WindowsApps\python.exe</code>). I'll give the installer a try since it's a surprisingly reasonable ~100 MB download. Apparently, Microsoft decided to <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/python-in-the-windows-10-may-2019-update/">insert this Python shim into Windows itself</a> just to make it easier for people to find Python. Interesting.</p>
<h1 id="going-through-the-tutorial">Going through the tutorial</h1>
<p>While going through <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/">Python's official tutorial</a>, there are some things I don't like:</p>
<p>Syntax gripes:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are <code>else</code> blocks on <em>loops</em></li>
<li><code>pass</code> is needed to denote empty blocks</li>
<li>There are abbreviations that are easy to forget, such as <code>elif</code></li>
<li><code>*</code>, <code>**</code>, and <code>/</code> are overused in Python's syntax</li>
<li>The syntax for both tuples and sets tries to be pretty, but just ends up creating weird edge cases, such as <code>item,</code> (requiring a trailing comma) for a single-item tuple and <code>{}</code> being an empty dictionary and not an empty set</li>
<li>&quot;f-strings&quot; can't be arbitrarily nested (i.e. you can't use quotation marks inside an f-string that is delimited by quotation marks)</li>
</ul>
<p>Module woes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The module loading system seems needlessly complicated (<code>__init__.py</code>, <code>__all__</code>, <code>import *</code>, etc.)<ul>
<li>It even <em>prepends</em> the main module's path to the search path, so local modules are loaded in preference to standard library modules of the same name (pro tip: never create a file named <code>random.py</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The default global scope has too many members</li>
<li>Virtual environments are <em>definitely</em> not my preferred solution to managing conflicting dependencies</li>
</ul>
<p>Scoping complaints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Variables introduced in a <code>for</code> loop go into the enclosing scope (making it easy to accidentally change variables in the enclosing scope)</li>
<li><code>global</code> seems dangerous</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="overall-first-impressions">Overall first impressions</h1>
<p>Here are my impressions after going through the Python tutorial and playing with Python for a few days:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't like the syntax, but I also don't dislike it as much as I expected to</li>
<li>There are some handy syntactical conveniences (e.g. list comprehensions)</li>
<li>I am strongly in favor of its &quot;batteries included&quot; approach that yields a robust standard library (it even has SQLite out of the box!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, Python's biggest advantages are its standard library and its popularity.</p>
<h1 id="next-steps">Next steps</h1>
<p>Now that I've read up on Python and written some basic scripts (mostly to solve <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> problems), I'm going to play around with machine learning using Python and NumPy.</p>
