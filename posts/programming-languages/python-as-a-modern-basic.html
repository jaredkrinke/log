<p>As far as programming languages go, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a> (&quot;Beginners&#39; All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code&quot;) is... <strong>not a language I would choose today</strong>. Granted, when it was originally developed in the 60s, line numbers and single-character identifiers were <em>an improvement</em>. But in its heyday (which I&#39;m going to claim, without evidence, was in the late 70s and early 80s), there were other options I like better (Pascal, Lisp, Forth, even C!). Yet, <strong>BASIC was everywhere! It <em>was</em> the interface for many old computers, like the Commodore 64.</strong> Why? I&#39;d say (again, without evidence) it&#39;s because BASIC was designed to be usable by anyone--not just experienced programmers.</p>
<p>Today, there&#39;s a <em>different</em> language which enjoys a strong following, often as a first language. That language is Python.</p>
<p><strong>Python is the new BASIC.</strong></p>
<h1 id="back-to-basic">Back to BASIC</h1>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>BASIC was created at Dartmouth College in 1963 by John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz (see <a href="https://computerhistory.org/blog/in-memoriam-thomas-e-kurtz-1928-2024/">In Memoriam: Thomas E. Kurtz, 1928â€“2024</a>). If you want a historical account, there is an <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/keeping-things-basic/id1459202600?i=1000502282724">Advent of Computing podcast episode about BASIC</a> that is excellent (as is the entire podcast).</p>
<h2 id="commodore-basic">Commodore BASIC</h2>
<p>My personal history with BASIC goes back to <a href="../vintage-computing/40-year-old-dev-environment.html">the first computer I ever used, the Commodore 64</a>. That computer booted directly into BASIC. Although I didn&#39;t realize it at the time, to launch programs, you had to type in BASIC code. <strong>Every user was secretly a programmer!</strong> I don&#39;t think I wrote any programs beyond <code>10 PRINT &quot;HAHA&quot;</code>; <code>20 GOTO 10</code>, but I suppose I at least learned about commands and quotation marks.</p>
<h2 id="qbasic">QBasic</h2>
<p>At some point, I decided that I wanted to make a computer do whatever I wanted, so I needed to learn how to program. Fortunately, my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a> computer included a development environment--impressively fully-featured, in retrospect--named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic">QBasic</a>. Yes, BASIC (specifically QBasic) was the first programming language I attempted to learn. I don&#39;t think I ever discovered subroutines in QBasic, but I did at least learn about conditionals, loops, and arrays.</p>
<p>Regardless, BASIC served its purpose. I, with no prior experience, learned how to write some simple programs without throwing up my hands in despair and swearing off computers forever. <strong>I guess I&#39;m a BASIC success story!</strong></p>
<p>As an aside, I recently found an old box of floppy disks, including one &quot;double density&quot; disk with my first name written on the label. That disk contained several programs I had written using QBasic, circa 1997. The code was... not good--again, I hadn&#39;t discovered subroutines yet.</p>
<h1 id="back-to-python">Back to Python</h1>
<p>Although not perfect, Python has a lot going for it:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#39;s <strong>ubiquitous</strong></li>
<li><strong>It comes with &quot;batteries included&quot;</strong>, i.e. a comprehensive standard library</li>
<li><strong>It&#39;s simple</strong> (or, at least, you can pretend it is, for casual use)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Python is often good enough.</strong></p>
<h2 id="why-python-is-the-new-basic">Why Python is the new BASIC</h2>
<p>But why is Python the new BASIC? The answer is simple: <strong>Python is the new BASIC because Python is the language that new programmers always seem to use</strong>. It&#39;s reached critical mass. Python has won!</p>
<p>Of course, that is more of an observation than a reason. I honestly have no idea why people originally gravitated to Python (apologies for implying otherwise), but if I had to guess it would be some combination of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python emerged when the world desperately needed a scripting language that was more approachable than <a href="https://www.perl.org/">Perl</a></li>
<li>Python often includes everything you need, right in the standard library</li>
<li>Python was math-friendly enough to gain a foothold in physics, finance, etc. research, thus broadening its ecosystem and influence</li>
<li>Python smartly borrowed convenient features from more complex languages, while retaining a simple look</li>
<li>Python was never owned by a litigious corporation</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words: <strong>some combination of smart design, community management, and happenstance</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="definitive-proof-of-pythons-dominance">Definitive proof of Python&#39;s dominance</h2>
<p>Despite preferred other programming languages for my entire adult life, <strong>I recently gave in and wrote a personal utility program in Python</strong> because I knew Python would have everything I needed and I had confidence that Python was entrenched enough that I&#39;d still be able to use my program for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p><strong>If even a Python-avoider like me defaults to using Python, then I think it&#39;s pretty clear that Python has taken over the world, just as BASIC once did.</strong></p>
<p>One parting thought: how long will Python&#39;s reign last?</p>
