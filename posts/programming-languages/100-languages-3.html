<p>I&#39;m <a href="https://log.schemescape.com/posts/programming-languages/100-languages.html">trying to write code in 100 different programming languages</a>. Today, I&#39;m wrapping up week 1.</p>
<p>The full list of languages and links to code are in my <a href="https://github.com/jaredkrinke/100-languages">100-languages</a> repository.</p>
<h1 id="days-1---2">Days 1 - 2</h1>
<p><strong>I got off to a pretty rocky start by starting with two languages that run in limited environments</strong>: <a href="100-languages-1.html">SIC-1 Assembly Language</a> (which runs on an 8-bit single-instruction CPU with 256 bytes addressable) and <a href="100-languages-2.html">SectorLISP</a> (which has only lists--no integers!--and with a max of a few thousand linked list cells). Economizing solutions was fun, but time-consuming.</p>
<h1 id="days-3---7">Days 3 - 7</h1>
<p>I could have breezed through the first week by using procedural languages I already knew, <strong>but the whole point of this journey is to play with new programming languages with minimal investment</strong>, so I set two goals for the rest of the week:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use at least one language of each type (cf. <a href="https://madhadron.com/programming/seven_ur_languages.html">The Seven Programming Ur-Languages</a>)</li>
<li>Explore new languages, or new ways of using languages, when possible</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the languages I ended up using:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://fortran-lang.org/">Fortran</a> (procedural language)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.jsoftware.com/#/">J</a> (array language)</li>
<li><a href="https://gforth.org/">Gforth</a> (stack-based language)</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML">Standard ML</a> (functional language)</li>
<li><a href="https://squeak.org/">Squeak</a>/Smalltalk (object-oriented language)</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a> (declarative language)</li>
</ul>
<p>Technically, I think I&#39;ve written Smalltalk and Standard ML code before, but it was a long time ago, and I definitely did not remember anything beyond high level concepts. SQL was the only language I was fluent in (but not for solving math problems!).</p>
<h1 id="doubts-about-this-challenge">Doubts about this challenge</h1>
<p>I&#39;ve tried to make it clear that <strong>I&#39;m not expecting to actually <em>learn</em> or <em>become proficient in</em> all of these languages</strong>--I&#39;m just sampling them and ensuring that I <em>apply</em> what little I <em>do</em> learn. Eventually, maybe I&#39;ll dive into a few of the languages that intrigued me the most.</p>
<p>Honestly, it&#39;s been fun to dabble in languages I have no business writing code for. In that aspect, this challenge has been a resounding success.</p>
<p><em>However</em>, sometimes <strong>it feels like this is actually just a challenge to learn 100 different syntaxes</strong>. In other words, <strong>I might be spending time on the <em>least interesting part</em> of any programming language: syntax</strong>. (Not to say syntax isn&#39;t important, just that syntax is <em>almost</em> never a reason to use or avoid a programming language. For the record, I said &quot;almost never&quot;.)</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if syntax overload ends up sinking this adventure, but for now I&#39;m planning to forge ahead.</p>
<h1 id="language-notes">Language notes</h1>
<p>I&#39;ll end this update with some notes about the languages I used.</p>
<h2 id="fortran">Fortran</h2>
<p><strong>Fortran is verbose</strong>. It tries to be precise, but there&#39;s enough historical baggage and implicit behavior that it seems really easy to screw up. I don&#39;t think this particular programming problem played to any of Fortran&#39;s strengths, however, so my perspective is skewed--I was basically writing C in Fortran.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Opted for Fortran 90, with extravagances like &quot;free-form source input&quot; (instead of fixed column input)</li>
<li>Requires lots of redundant typing (function names and return types, variable definitions)</li>
<li>Native logical/Boolean type!</li>
<li><a href="https://fortran-lang.org/learn/quickstart/gotchas/">Plenty of gotchas</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="j">J</h2>
<p>I was excited to try an array language, <strong>but <em>wow</em> was I unprepared for the overwhelming cyclone of syntax</strong>. Like regular expressions, I&#39;m sure once you&#39;re proficient with J it&#39;s quick to whip up little programs. Also like regular expressions, J seems difficult to parse at a glance. <strong>Trying to wade through dozens of sigils as quickly as possible was probably the worst possible introduction to J</strong>.</p>
<p>Despite being in the wrong mindset, I <em>did</em> enjoy programming in J, because it felt so novel. The closest I&#39;ve used to an array language is probably <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a>, but J is its own language, designed from the ground up.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>_5</code> is a negative number and <code>_</code> is infinity</li>
<li><code>3 : 0</code> defines a verb (operator) -- hopefully there&#39;s a good reason for this...</li>
<li>Unique terminology (&quot;verbs&quot;, &quot;adverbs&quot;, &quot;ravel&quot;) makes it hard to find information in the wiki</li>
<li>Search engines don&#39;t seem to understand that &quot;J&quot; is the name of a programming language -- only good way to search was on Stack Overflow with the <code>[j]</code> tag</li>
<li>Comments start with <code>NB.</code>!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gforth">Gforth</h2>
<p>After reading a <a href="https://ratfactor.com/forth/the_programming_language_that_writes_itself.html">very long and entertaining post about Forth</a> roughly a year ago, I&#39;ve wanted to give Forth a try. Forth&#39;s minimalism aligns nicely with <a href="minimal-dev-env.html">my own aspirations</a>. Who knows, maybe Forth will <a href="http://duskos.org/">control a post-apocalyptic world</a>.</p>
<p>I was prepared for Forth&#39;s minimal syntax (even more minimal than Lisp) and I knew how to use a stack. <strong>But I underestimated just how <em>exasperatingly tedious</em> managing the parameter stack would be</strong>. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s some better solution for temporaries that I skimmed over, but having to <code>SWAP 1 + SWAP</code>, etc. was inconvenient.</p>
<p>Overall, I&#39;m not sure how I feel about Forth outside of the embedded world. I <em>do</em> hope to implement my own Forth one day--and maybe with the benefit of enlightenment I&#39;ll feel differently.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>I actually kind of enjoyed having no type-checking, not even at run-time--although it&#39;s probably not usually a good idea</li>
<li>Interacting with Forth really feels like interacting directly with hardware</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="standard-ml">Standard ML</h2>
<p><strong>I love arrow functions, map, reduce, etc.</strong> -- and I have functional programming languages to thank for those, even when I&#39;m using JavaScript. Having said that, Standard ML was the first language I ran into during this challenge where it felt like I was wasting my time stumbling through syntax. I still don&#39;t know when I need parentheses and when I don&#39;t. As usual, this is not necessarily the fault of the language--just of the environment I&#39;ve created for myself.</p>
<p>Having said that (and I&#39;m sure people will disagree), <strong>I prefer Lisp&#39;s regular syntax when compared to something like Standard ML</strong>. Maybe I&#39;d like Clojure?</p>
<h2 id="squeak">Squeak</h2>
<p>I was prepared for everything to be an object in Squeak. I was excited for a fully introspectable language. Want to know what something does? Just look at its source!</p>
<p><strong>I was <em>not</em> prepared for clicking through menus and having to use the mouse all the time</strong>. I&#39;m also not sold on image-based development being <em>the default</em>.</p>
<p>In the end, I think there&#39;s a lot of value in a standardized development environment and separating logic into objects, but I think most of those benefits are visible when working in teams or over longer periods of time.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the browser</li>
<li>Use all your mouse buttons</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sql">SQL</h2>
<p>Similar to J, <strong>it&#39;s fun to tell the computer <em>what</em> I want it to do without having to specify the particular steps for <em>how</em> to do it</strong>.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#39;s possible to produce a range of numbers in SQLite!</li>
<li>Strings can be automatically coerced to numbers in SQLite</li>
</ul>
