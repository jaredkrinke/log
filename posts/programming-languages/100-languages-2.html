<p>I&#39;m <a href="https://log.schemescape.com/posts/programming-languages/100-languages.html">trying to write code in 100 different programming languages</a>. Day (ahem) 2: <strong>SectorLISP</strong>!</p>
<h1 id="sectorlisp">SectorLISP</h1>
<p>Ever since discovering <a href="https://justine.lol/sectorlisp2/">SectorLISP</a> (a minimal Lisp that fits in a boot sector), I&#39;ve wanted to give it a spin. And it did not disappoint! It was both beautiful and painful.</p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>Things I missed while using SectorLISP:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tail call optimization</li>
<li>Mutation</li>
<li>Integers</li>
<li>Iteration</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw60/CLHS/Body/s_let_l.htm"><code>LET</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Mercifully, I was using the &quot;friendly&quot; branch of SectorLISP, which at least included an obvious and idiomatic way to implement recursion via <code>DEFINE</code>.</p>
<p>Now, obviously, <strong>the list above is not meant as a complaint</strong>. SectorLISP is a <em>minimal</em> Lisp, so I was expecting for it to support only the bare minimum. <strong>Rolling your own integer representation and using recursion for iteration are part of the fun!</strong></p>
<p>Having said that, there was one unpleasant surprise: because SectorLISP was designed to run on ancient hardware, <strong>it has a miniscule memory budget</strong>. There is only space for (I think) <em>at most</em> 8,192 cons cells. Without tail call optimization and iteration, several of my attempts at printing decimal numbers ran out of memory.</p>
<p><strong>In the end, I punted on printing in decimal</strong> and decided to print out the result in hexadecimal (which is easily computed from my &quot;list of binary bits&quot; integer representation). I am a miserable failure! But I need to move on.</p>
