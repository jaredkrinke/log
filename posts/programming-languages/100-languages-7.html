<p>I&#39;m <em>still</em> trying to <a href="https://log.schemescape.com/posts/programming-languages/100-languages.html">write code in 100 different programming languages</a>. My progress is being recorded in <a href="https://github.com/jaredkrinke/100-languages">this repository</a>. I&#39;m roughly one third of the way to 100 languages already!</p>
<p>In this update, I explored stack-based languages and (unintentionally) <strong>traveled the programming language syntax continuum, from (almost) no syntax to (almost) <em>only</em> syntax</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="weeks-4-and-5">Weeks 4 and 5</h1>
<p>Given my previous struggles with Forth-like stack-based languages, I decided to focus on stack-based and/or concatenative languages.</p>
<h2 id="retroforth">RetroForth</h2>
<p>RetroForth bills itself as a &quot;modern, pragmatic Forth&quot;, and I agree with that description. It adds one-character &quot;sigils&quot; to distinguish numbers, strings, definitions, comments, etc. These sigils allegedly simplify the interpreter, and I think this one extra bit of syntax is helpful.</p>
<p>Overall, I enjoyed Retro&#39;s take on Forth, and I finally felt like I was making progress on creating simpler, more idiomatic Forth code.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Got in infinite loops several times</li>
<li>Fatal errors are just numbers and I don&#39;t know where to look them up</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="uxntal">Uxntal</h2>
<p>Ever since reading about <a href="https://100r.co/site/uxn.html">uxn</a>, I&#39;d wanted to see what a simple VM that runs on an NES could look like. After digging in a bit more, I learned that uxn was inspired by Forth--that got my attention!</p>
<p>After writing some code in uxn&#39;s assembly language (tal), I&#39;ll say that I mostly like uxn (the virtual machine), but... I struggled with tal.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Numbers <em>must</em> be written in lowercase hexadecimal (decimal not supported)</li>
<li>Instructions can set a &quot;keep&quot; bit that causes inputs to remain on the stack</li>
<li>The instruction set doesn&#39;t include modulus/remainder</li>
<li>Supports both global and local labels, which is convenient</li>
<li>Instructions must be UPPERCASE (except for flags), but hexadecimal must be lowercase</li>
<li><strong>Names like <code>b1</code> aren&#39;t allowed</strong> because they&#39;re actually hexadecimal numbers...</li>
<li>Mixing 8-bit and 16-bit values on the stack is tricky</li>
<li>Must specify <code>&amp;</code> on relative references, but not <code>@</code> on global references...</li>
<li>Pro tip: don&#39;t DUP relative addresses!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="apl">APL</h2>
<p>After playing with J and K (although I couldn&#39;t actually find an official implementation of K5), it was time to play with their spiritual predecessor, APL.</p>
<p>With J, I felt like I was re-learning Perl-compatible regular expressions, but with a much larger menu of ASCII sigils. APL is the same, <strong>except I can&#39;t type (and don&#39;t even know the names of) the sigils</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="factor">Factor</h2>
<p><strong>Factor is the niftiest concatenative language I&#39;ve tried</strong>.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, it borrows heavily from Common Lisp (e.g. restarts, editor integration, multiple dispatch, image-based development). I&#39;d even go as far to say that, in my limited experience, <strong>Factor feels like a concatenative expression of Common Lisp</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Common Lisp-like restarts!</li>
<li><a href="https://andreaferretti.github.io/factor-tutorial/">This Factor tutorial</a> is a great introduction--not just to Forth, but to concatenative languages in general</li>
<li>Factor&#39;s compiler validates documented stack effects</li>
<li>Factor supports editor integration, e.g. &quot;go to definition&quot;</li>
<li>Can save images, refresh files from disk, etc.</li>
<li>Built-in help</li>
<li>Support for local variables, using <code>::</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rebol">Rebol</h2>
<p><strong>Rebol is a minimal, but impressively capable scripting language</strong>. The entire language, including GUI support is well under 1 MB. How did I not run across Rebol when I was <a href="minimal-dev-env-5.html">looking for a minimal development environment</a>!? I only scratched the surface of Rebol, but it felt like exactly what I was looking for.</p>
<p>Having said that, I&#39;m uncertain about the future of Rebol--it doesn&#39;t appear to fully support 64-bit architectures.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Entire language is 440 KB!</li>
<li>Used the console version</li>
<li>Variables in functions don&#39;t default to locals?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bash">Bash</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve successfully been avoiding writing Bash recently, but I thought it might be fun to see what math looks like in Bash.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unpleasant syntax (double parentheses, double brackets)</li>
<li>Little inconsistencies, e.g. <code>fi</code> vs <code>done</code></li>
<li>Lots of symbols to remember: <code>#</code>, <code>@</code>, <code>/</code></li>
<li>But <em>very</em> widely deployed!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="julia">Julia</h2>
<p>From my uninformed perspective, Julia looks like a great language for academics.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Excellent documentation!</li>
<li>Base runtime includes a constant indicating the precision of floating points numbers!</li>
<li>Has a REPL, but I didn&#39;t use it</li>
<li>Built-in rational type!</li>
<li>My solution is horrible and didn&#39;t take advantage of any of Julia&#39;s nice features...</li>
</ul>
