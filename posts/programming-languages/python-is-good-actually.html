<p>Today, I discovered that my <a href="python-as-a-modern-basic.html">Python is the new BASIC</a> post had been discussed on a popular site. It's always a joy when people take an interest in your work, right? Well...</p>
<p><strong>In the comments, I was rightly roasted.</strong></p>
<p>Consider this post an apology and a promise to do better.</p>
<p>(Note: I went back and edited the post in question. This commentary applies to the original content.)</p>
<h1 id="problems-with-my-post">Problems with my post</h1>
<p>First off, <strong>the overall tone of the post crossed the line from criticism to snark--or maybe even scorn</strong>. In my head, some of the jabs were just good-natured ribbing, but upon re-reading from the perspective of an internet stranger, it's just oozing with derision. If I'm going to post something publicly, I should remember that <strong>the audience is not myself, but just anyone who happens to come along</strong> (except AI scrapers, per robots.txt).</p>
<p>Additionally, I didn't clearly articulate my complaints with Python. I think some them are legitimate but, besides being better explained elsewhere, <strong>my issues are not even that relevant</strong>. The things I like about Python outweigh the things I dislike. And <strong>there is a huge advantage to having a common programming language that everyone understands</strong> (even if only the basics). I like keeping posts short, and a good way to do that is to stay on topic and cut out (most of) the snark.</p>
<h1 id="not-just-python">Not just Python</h1>
<p>And it's not just Python. I've also whined about perceived bloat on, ahem, more than one occasion. I've complained about compilers not working on the first try. And so on. <strong>There isn't any value in posting shallow dismissals of projects that took enormous amounts of work to produce</strong>. I'll try to stop doing that. <strong>Even if I can't always make the world better, I can at least try to not make it worse</strong>.</p>
<p>Mea culpa.</p>
