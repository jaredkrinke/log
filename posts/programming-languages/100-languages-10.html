<p>In March, I set a lofty goal to <a href="100-languages.html">solve 100 Project Euler problems using 100 different programming languages, all within 100 days</a>. Slightly over 100 days later, I&#39;ll admit that <strong>I only made it <a href="100-languages-9.html">slightly beyond</a> <a href="50-different-languages.html">50</a></strong>, although that&#39;s not too bad considering that I quietly set this project aside a few weeks ago.</p>
<p><strong>I&#39;m not abandoning this effort, but I am definitely taking a break from it.</strong> And I&#39;m not setting it aside because it isn&#39;t fun (though I do wonder if it&#39;s <a href="../misc/my-hobby-is-bikeshedding.html">a good use of my time</a>). At the moment, I just have more important and interesting things to attend to.</p>
<h1 id="conquests">Conquests</h1>
<p>For the record, I&#39;d like to state that, so far, <strong>I&#39;m most proud of the following solutions</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jaredkrinke/100-languages/blob/main/src/p1.sic1">SIC-1 Assembly Language</a>, because it was hard to cram into 253 bytes</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jaredkrinke/100-languages/blob/main/src/p2.lisp">SectorLISP</a>, because I had to implement arithmetic <em>twice</em></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jaredkrinke/100-languages/blob/main/src/p17.v">Verilog</a>, because hardware</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jaredkrinke/100-languages/blob/main/src/p19.exa">EXA</a>, because <a href="https://www.zachtronics.com/exapunks/">Exapunks</a> is a great game</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jaredkrinke/100-languages/blob/main/src/p26.asm">x86 boot sector</a>, because I didn&#39;t want SectorLISP and SectorForth to have all the fun</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jaredkrinke/100-languages/blob/main/src/p34-scaled.png">Piet</a>, because coding in 2D, using pixels, was hard</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jaredkrinke/100-languages/blob/main/src/p54.ts">TypeScript&#39;s type system</a>, because I wanted to see if it was possible (see <a href="extreme-typing-in-typescript.html">blog post</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="and-a-few-stragglers">And a few stragglers</h1>
<p>With all that said, there are a couple of languages I haven&#39;t yet mentioned on here:</p>
<h2 id="haxe">Haxe</h2>
<ul>
<li>I like the idea of a portable language</li>
<li>But I didn&#39;t like the Java-like levels of ceremonial keywords/classes</li>
<li>Having said that, I prefer Haxe&#39;s familiar syntax and conveniences over something mroe minimal, like <a href="100-languages-9.html#wax">wax</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="k">K</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/JohnEarnest/ok">oK</a> is literally the only version of K I could even find</li>
<li>oK also only had the only detailed documentation of K that I could find</li>
<li>I&#39;m compelled to contrast this with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_(programming_language)">J</a> (another array language), which is open source and has plenty of documentation</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="thats-all">That&#39;s all</h1>
<p>That was a short update, but it feels good to tie up those loose ends.</p>
