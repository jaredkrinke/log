<p>In order to test out fully interactive program development (<a href="learning-lisp-in-2023.html">as noted previously</a>), I&#39;ve been learning Common Lisp. I assumed that it would take a while to catch up on nearly four decades of Common Lisp&#39;s progress and... I was not wrong about that. On the plus side, given the long timeline, there <em>are</em> a lot of resources available. On the flip side, they&#39;re not always up to date.</p>
<p>Regardless, here are the resources that I&#39;ve found most helpful over the last couple of weeks. My intention is to keep this list up to date as I go.</p>

<h1 id="thats-great-but-what-have-you-been-doing">That&#39;s great, but what have you been <em>doing</em>?</h1>
<p>That&#39;s mostly a topic for a future post. Briefly: my first project has been building a service that hosts webhooks which implement <a href="https://play.battlesnake.com/">Battlesnake</a> clients. Surely there&#39;s no more noble endeavour than programming games!</p>
<p>Battlesnake is a competitive programming game where snakes move around a grid collecting food and trying not to collide with each other or the walls. Each snake is implemented as a webhook which is given 500 milliseconds to respond with the direction it would like to move. It&#39;s a simple concept, but that just leaves lots of room for optimization. As an aside, the global leaderboard is a little bit pointless in that it can&#39;t take into account hardware, so for all I know my little netbook is competing with a rack of servers, but I&#39;m still having fun.</p>
<p>Hopefully I&#39;ll have more to say about Battlesnake and Common Lisp soon!</p>
