<p>I&#39;m testing out <a href="comparison.html">the most promising static site generators</a> to see which is closest to <a href="overview.html">my ideal setup</a>. First up is <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>.</p>
<h1 id="hugo">Hugo</h1>
<p>First up is Hugo since it&#39;s the easiest to install and (<a href="https://jamstack.org/generators/">according to Jamstack</a>) is one of the top 3 most loved static site generators.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>Installation is just downloading a binary. Great!</p>
<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>Going through their <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">quick start guide</a>, I use <code>hugo new site quickstart</code> to create Hugo&#39;s desired directory structure. It&#39;s a bit more convoluted than I expected (what is <code>archetypes</code> for?). Interesting.</p>
<h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2>
<p>Hugo seems powerful, but, as we all know, power <del>corrupts</del> introduces complexity. This is my best understanding of Hugo&#39;s concepts (which map to directories):</p>
<ul>
<li>Archetypes: Default file contents for each types of content file<ul>
<li>Since I&#39;ve only got a simple dev blog, I&#39;ll probably only need a single &quot;post&quot; content type, and their default (title, date, draft status) is likely sufficient</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Assets: Stores all the files which need be processed by <a href="https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/">Hugo Pipes</a><ul>
<li>This can be used to minify CSS, JavaScript, etc.</li>
<li>Minifying CSS is a bonus feature I didn&#39;t ask for, but it could be worthwhile</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Content: Actual content can be separated by type (note: I believe this is how archetypes are matched)</li>
<li>Data: I&#39;m actually unclear on how this is different from the <code>config</code> directory</li>
<li>Layout: Templates</li>
<li>Static: Files that are copied verbatim to the output</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="templatestheme">Templates/theme</h2>
<p>The next step is to add a theme. Huh, I thought I&#39;d just plop in some HTML with curly brackets and build my own site. In the past, every theme I&#39;ve used with a static site generator has been fairly bloated (even so-called &quot;minimal&quot; themes).</p>
<p>I&#39;ll eventually try and use my hand-crafted, minimal semantic HTML, but I suppose I can start with their suggested initial theme, &quot;Ananke&quot;. It looks like <a href="https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/whats-the-difference-between-themes-and-layouts/4851">themes mainly exist to allow reuse by other people</a>, so I could perhaps even get away without a theme (using layouts exclusively).</p>
<h2 id="first-run">First run</h2>
<p>The directory structure is pretty close to what I already had, so I was already to launch the Hugo server:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cmd">hugo.exe server -D
<span class="hljs-built_in">Start</span> building sites â€¦ 
...
<span class="hljs-function">Error: <span class="hljs-title">Error</span> <span class="hljs-title">building</span> <span class="hljs-title">site</span>: <span class="hljs-title">TOCSS</span>: <span class="hljs-title">failed</span> <span class="hljs-title">to</span> <span class="hljs-title">transform</span> &quot;<span class="hljs-title">ananke</span>/<span class="hljs-title">css</span>/<span class="hljs-title">main.css</span>&quot; (<span class="hljs-title">text</span>/<span class="hljs-title">css</span>). <span class="hljs-title">Check</span> <span class="hljs-title">your</span> <span class="hljs-title">Hugo</span> <span class="hljs-title">installation</span>; <span class="hljs-title">you</span> <span class="hljs-title">need</span> <span class="hljs-title">the</span> <span class="hljs-title">extended</span> <span class="hljs-title">version</span> <span class="hljs-title">to</span> <span class="hljs-title">build</span> <span class="hljs-title">SCSS</span>/<span class="hljs-title">SASS</span>.
<span class="hljs-title">Built</span> <span class="hljs-title">in</span> 213 <span class="hljs-title">ms</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>Well, that&#39;s not encouraging. Apparently there&#39;s an extended version that I glossed over and is quietly required for their quick start. I do wonder why there&#39;s a separate build when the difference in size is only 8%. Maybe it&#39;s bundling other non-Go executables that aren&#39;t available everywhere?</p>
<p>With <em>extended</em> Hugo, the site served up fine and the default theme initially looked adequate, but it had a lot of junk I didn&#39;t want. Observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>There were corporate logos on each post&#39;s page</li>
<li>An inaccurate copyright notice was added</li>
<li>My first post&#39;s HTML was 3,957 bytes zipped</li>
<li>The CSS was 15kb zipped</li>
<li>Surprisingly, there was also a CSS source map that weighed in at 187kb uncompressed that I see no reason to upload with my site</li>
</ul>
<p>I guess I was right to be wary of default themes.</p>
<p>A few additional Hugo-related notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supplying &quot;date&quot; metadata appears to be required in Hugo (unless you want the date to be displayed as &quot;January 1, 0001&quot;)</li>
<li>Viewing the HTML files on disk led to broken links because a &quot;/&quot; prefix is added to all the links (not the end of the world since <code>hugo.exe</code> can run a server, but still not what I&#39;d hoped for)</li>
<li>Hugo generates an entire directory for each post -- I was expecting one directory per category, with HTML files for each post</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="using-a-custom-theme">Using a custom theme</h2>
<p>Hugo&#39;s documentation was surprisingly unhelpful when it comes to creating a theme from scratch. At least Hugo is popular enough that I was able to find a blog article about <a href="https://retrolog.io/blog/creating-a-hugo-theme-from-scratch/">creating a Hugo theme from scratch</a>.</p>
<p>My first reaction is that <a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/introduction/">Hugo&#39;s template language</a> is bizarre. I thought I&#39;d just be writing code with Go syntax, but instead I&#39;m seeing examples like this:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-template-variable">{{ <span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-built_in">if</span></span> (<span class="hljs-name">isset</span> .Params <span class="hljs-string">&quot;description&quot;</span>) }}</span><span class="language-xml">
    </span><span class="hljs-template-variable">{{ <span class="hljs-name">index</span> .Params <span class="hljs-string">&quot;description&quot;</span> }}</span><span class="language-xml">
</span><span class="hljs-template-variable">{{ <span class="hljs-name">else</span> }}</span><span class="language-xml">
    </span><span class="hljs-template-variable">{{ <span class="hljs-name">.Summary</span> }}</span><span class="language-xml">
</span><span class="hljs-template-variable">{{ <span class="hljs-name">end</span> }}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Learning a new language that looks nothing like the languages I&#39;m used to is not something I wanted to have to do for my simple site. Additionally, <a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/lookup-order/">Hugo&#39;s lookup rules</a> are much more complicated than I expected. I&#39;m still not sure if files like <code>layouts/_default/baseof.html</code> are hard-coded names or if there&#39;s logic somewhere I could simplify in the configuration.</p>
<p>Additional notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>It looks like the &quot;/&quot; prefix for paths that I saw earlier is just a shortcut for not having to compute the path to the root of the site, e.g. &quot;css/style.css&quot; won&#39;t work when in a subdirectory, but &quot;/css/style.css&quot; will work... unless you&#39;re viewing directly from the file system (where &quot;/&quot; means the file system root)</li>
<li>I was unable to get the 404 page to work using <code>hugo.exe server</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lets-stop-there-for-now">Let&#39;s stop there for now</h2>
<p>Although install was simple and the server worked, at this point, I&#39;m not interested in learning Hugo&#39;s unintuitive template language. I honestly found <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/XSL/">XSL</a> to be more intuitive (and that is not a compliment).</p>
<p>For posterity, I saved my terribly incomplete theme here:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jaredkrinke/hugo-bare-minimum">https://github.com/jaredkrinke/hugo-bare-minimum</a></p>
<p>Let&#39;s hope the next static site generator I try is more my style!</p>
