<p>After <a href="../comparison/">testing out a bunch of static site generators</a>, I settled on using <a href="../metalsmith/">Metalsmith</a> for this site. I like that Metalsmith has a simple design that can be easily extended with plugins (either custom or &quot;off the shelf&quot;), but that&#39;s not to say that Metalsmith is perfect.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s dive into the downsides of Metalsmith.</p>
<h1 id="is-metalsmith-being-maintained">Is Metalsmith being maintained?</h1>
<p>There&#39;s the question of ownership and maintenance. Metalsmith was created by <a href="https://segment.com/">Segment</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith">main repository</a> lives under their GitHub account. Maintenance duties were <a href="https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith/pull/324/files">transferred in 2018</a>, but there have been no nontrivial commits since then.</p>
<p><strong>A pessimistic view is that Metalsmith is a zombie project.</strong></p>
<p>It&#39;s possible that Metalsmith is simple enough that it doesn&#39;t <em>need</em> any updates, but if you do run into a problem with Metalsmith itself, you&#39;re probably going to have to fix it yourself.</p>
<p>This, to me, is probably the biggest downside of building on top of Metalsmith.</p>
<h1 id="are-the-plugins-being-maintained">Are the plugins being maintained?</h1>
<p>If you take the optimistic view that Metalsmith&#39;s core is rock-solid and not in need of updates, how about the plugins? In many cases, <strong>plugins also appear to be unmaintained</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, take the <a href="https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith-collections">metalsmith-collections</a> plugin. Its last commit was 3 years ago, but even worse, the <a href="https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith-collections">associated NPM package</a> was published 5 years ago. In fact, the published package <a href="https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith-collections/issues/91">doesn&#39;t even contain the most up-to-date version of the plugin</a>. I ran into this particular issue because I wanted to use the plugin&#39;s <code>filterBy</code> option, but that functionality isn&#39;t actually present in the NPM package&#39;s version.</p>
<p>This is unfortunate, but there&#39;s nothing stopping you from forking and updating plugins yourself.</p>
<h1 id="official-forum-sign-up-requirements">Official forum sign-up requirements</h1>
<p><a href="https://metalsmith.io/">Metalsmith&#39;s home page</a> points to a <a href="https://gitter.im/">Gitter</a> community, which I interpret to be the official forum.</p>
<p>While I like the <em>idea</em> of an open source Discord alternative, I was very disappointed with my first experience using (well, attemping to use) Gitter.</p>
<p>Gitter was originally created as a way to chat about GitHub projects, so it was naturally tied to GitHub accounts. This was fine then, but even today Gitter requires one of the following accounts for login:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub</li>
<li>GitLab</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
</ul>
<p>I use GitHub and have a high opinion of both it and GitLab (Twitter, not so much). But Gitter&#39;s <em>default, required</em> access requests are repulsive:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub: &quot;This application will be able to read your ... private project boards.&quot;</li>
<li>GitLab: &quot;Grants complete read/write access ... including all groups and projects ...&quot;</li>
<li>Twitter: Requires a phone number to sign up (that I assume Twitter turns around and sells to advertisers)</li>
</ul>
<p>If I already used Twitter, that would be an acceptable option here, but I have no interest in donating my personal data to yet another gigantic advertising company. Without a Twitter account, none of the login options seem even remotely reasonable.</p>
<p>In the end, I created a dummy GitHub account just to access Gitter (which essentially negates any user benefit of using OAuth).</p>
<h1 id="so-do-i-hate-metalsmith-no">So do I hate Metalsmith? No!</h1>
<p>Honestly, this article makes a compelling case for avoiding Metalsmith--yet, I still use it. Why?</p>
<p>As someone who&#39;s familiar with JavaScript, Node, and HTML/CSS, Metalsmith is simply the easiest static site generator for me to use:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#39;s simple enough that I know exactly what it&#39;s doing</li>
<li>It&#39;s easy to customize and extend</li>
<li>Simple plugins already exist for most of the things I want to do</li>
<li>It supports <a href="https://github.com/jstransformers">pretty much any template language</a></li>
<li>I can even debug it, just by hitting F5 in VS Code</li>
</ul>
<p>Metalsmith is really giving me the best of both using a pre-built static site generator and creating my own. It&#39;s possible that the lack of maintenance will force me to switch to something else eventually, but for now I&#39;m happy with it.</p>
