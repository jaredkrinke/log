<p>Static site generators (like <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, <a href="https://jaredkrinke.github.io/md2blog/">md2blog</a>, or my latest fascination, <a href="https://www.getblades.org/">Blades</a>) read input (often Markdown files) and produce output (HTML). Build tools (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)">Make</a>) read input and produce output (or run tools that do so).</p>
<p>Static site generators and build tools sound similar. What makes them different?</p>
<h1 id="differences">Differences</h1>
<p>Here are some general differences:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Delegation</th>
<th>Build graph</th>
<th>Rebuilds</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Static site generators</strong></td>
<td>Self-contained, no external tools</td>
<td>Inputs are discovered and dynamic outputs are supported</td>
<td>Rebuilds restart from scratch</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Build tools</strong></td>
<td>Delegate compilation to external tools</td>
<td>Inputs and outputs are prescriptively listed</td>
<td>Intermediate objects are cached to the file system, enabling fast incremental rebuilds</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Let's consider these each in turn.</p>
<h2 id="delegation">Delegation</h2>
<p>Build tools (like Make) usually delegate processing to external tools (like a C compiler). <strong>This makes build tools more generic</strong> (they can support multiple languages). Static site generators are less flexible (usually only supporting one or two types of input), so there isn't much motivation to extract processing into a separate tool.</p>
<h2 id="build-graph">Build graph</h2>
<p>Build tools are generally used to produce specific artifacts that are known ahead of time. Although it's possible to do so, I can't think of very many cases where you'd want a build tool to enumerate arbitrary files and producing unknown (or unexpected) outputs.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <strong>it's more convenient to author a few Markdown files and then have a static site generator automatically find them and rebuild the site</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="rebuilds">Rebuilds</h2>
<p><strong>Because compilers are often slow, it is frequently important for build tools to cache intermediate objects to the file system, to avoid recompiling unchanged items</strong>. Processing Markdown and generating HTML is generally fast, so there's less need to cache intermediate data.</p>
<p>Additionally, incremental rebuilds <em>require</em> the build graph to be easy to compute ahead of time. Now, I don't see a reason why static site generators <em>couldn't</em> infer (and cache) a build graph to support incremental rebuilds (in fact, I <a href="lisp-ssg.html">prototyped a generic static site generator with accurate incremental rebuilds</a>... <a href="speeding-up-rebuilds-2.html">twice</a>), but it's not as urgent of a concern for static site generators since building static sites is generally quick (<a href="speeding-up-rebuilds.html">unless you're on slow hardware</a>).</p>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>If I had to distill my thoughts into one sentence, I'd say that the build graph is the essential part: <strong>static site generators discover their inputs and produce arbitrary outputs whereas build tools know their outputs ahead of time</strong>. Oh, and static site generators produce HTML instead of programs, obviously.</p>
<p>I'm sure there are exceptions, and you could argue that static site generators are a subset of build tools, but I'm going to dogmatically stick to the bolded claim above.</p>
