<p>I&#39;m testing out <a href="../comparison/">the most promising static site generators</a> to see which is closest to <a href="../overview/">my ideal setup</a>. Next up is <a href="https://metalsmith.io/">Metalsmith</a>.</p>
<p>Spoiler: I really like Metalsmith&#39;s modular design, so much so that I&#39;m now using Metalsmith for this blog.</p>
<h1 id="metalsmith">Metalsmith</h1>
<p>Metalsmith is a Node-based static site generator with a modular architecture that relies on many small plugins (similar in style to <a href="https://gulpjs.com/">gulp</a>). Installation is done via NPM (but note that you&#39;ll likely need to track down and install many plugins).</p>
<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>
<p>Metalsmith is configured using plain old JavaScript code and building the site is just a matter of running your script, which is especially nice for debugging issues. See their &quot;elevator pitch&quot; on the <a href="https://metalsmith.io/">Metalsmith home page</a> for an example. It&#39;s refreshingly simple and transparent, but you&#39;ll need to install plugins and write some code to get a test server with live reloading (unlike many other modern static site generators that support this out the box).</p>
<p>While vetting and adding plugins is tedious, I like the fact that Metalsmith doesn&#39;t install 500+ packages by default (... like Eleventy).</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/jstransformers/jstransformer">jstransformer</a>, Metalsmith supports a wide variety of template languages. I&#39;m not a fan of <a href="https://liquidjs.com/">Liquid</a> or <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/">Nunjucks</a>, but I&#39;m trying out <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a> because I find it more intuitive and less verbose. So far, it seems easier to maintain than the plain JavaScript templates I used with <a href="../eleventy-2/">Eleventy</a>.</p>
<h2 id="themes">Themes?</h2>
<p>If you don&#39;t want to author your own HTML templates, Metalsmith honestly doesn&#39;t seem like a good choice. It&#39;s possible to construct a Metalsmith &quot;theme&quot; by combining plugins, configuration, and templates, but really what you&#39;re providing is an entire skeleton project (with a <code>package.json</code> file, build scripts, and so on). This means the result is less portable and more difficult to integrate (unless you&#39;re starting from scratch and don&#39;t have any opinions or constraints).</p>
<p>Other static site generators (e.g. Hugo) abstract out the concept of a theme (along with standard metadata that themes can leverage), so you don&#39;t have to mix code and configuration together with HTML templates and CSS styling. This seems better for people who don&#39;t want total control of every character in their final HTML output.</p>
<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p><a href="https://metalsmith.io/#introduction">Metalsmith&#39;s home page</a> has a sample script right at the top you can look at, but you&#39;ll end up with a bunch of <code>require(...)</code>s followed by something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title class_">Metalsmith</span>(__dirname)
    .<span class="hljs-title function_">metadata</span>({
        <span class="hljs-attr">site</span>: {
            <span class="hljs-attr">title</span>: <span class="hljs-string">&quot;Schemescape&quot;</span>,
            <span class="hljs-attr">url</span>: <span class="hljs-string">&quot;https://log.schemescape.com/&quot;</span>,
            <span class="hljs-attr">description</span>: <span class="hljs-string">&quot;Development log of a life-long coder&quot;</span>,
        },
    })
    .<span class="hljs-title function_">source</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;./content&quot;</span>)
    .<span class="hljs-title function_">destination</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;./out&quot;</span>)
    .<span class="hljs-title function_">use</span>(<span class="hljs-title function_">collections</span>({
        <span class="hljs-attr">posts</span>: {
            <span class="hljs-attr">pattern</span>: <span class="hljs-string">&quot;posts/**/*.md&quot;</span>,
            <span class="hljs-attr">sortBy</span>: <span class="hljs-string">&quot;date&quot;</span>,
            <span class="hljs-attr">reverse</span>: <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>,
        }
    }))
    .<span class="hljs-title function_">use</span>(<span class="hljs-title function_">markdown</span>())
    .<span class="hljs-title function_">use</span>(<span class="hljs-title function_">layouts</span>({
        <span class="hljs-attr">directory</span>: <span class="hljs-string">&quot;templates&quot;</span>,
        <span class="hljs-attr">default</span>: <span class="hljs-string">&quot;default.hbs&quot;</span>,
    }))
    ...
    .<span class="hljs-title function_">build</span>(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">err</span> =&gt;</span> { <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (err) <span class="hljs-keyword">throw</span> err; });</code></pre>
<p>If you just want to build a dev blog like everyone else, it does feel like a lot of boilerplate code, but I like that it forces you to consider and understand each step of the process. Some of the other static site generators were too proactive and did things I didn&#39;t expect or understand (or want). With Metalsmith, it only does exactly what you tell it.</p>
<p>But there&#39;s a dark side to Metalsmith&#39;s simple model, and that&#39;s that Metalsmith has to be taught to do even the most basic things. For example, I&#39;m building my site on Windows, which has the unfortunate property of using backslashes for path separators. Metalsmith doesn&#39;t seem to know or care about this detail, so I had to actually write code to switch to web-friendly forward slashes when creating links between files in different directories.</p>
<h3 id="plugins-plugins-plugins">Plugins, plugins, plugins</h3>
<p>Metalsmith&#39;s modular architecture with a very simple core library means you need plugins--a lot of plugins. Fortunately, most of the functionality I was interested in already existed in the form of published plugins (some official, some third party). Here are the ones I used:</p>
<table>

</tbody></table>
<p>Note that some of the plugins I installed had dependencies flagged by NPM as having vulnerabilities. I reviewed the notices and none seemed concerning for my use case (e.g. all of the input is code/content I wrote and I don&#39;t plan on targeting myself for a regular expression denial of service attack).</p>
<h3 id="missing-plugins">Missing plugins</h3>
<p>Despite all these great plugins, I did end up needing to add a little extra functionality. Theoretically, these could be packaged into plugins.</p>
<ul>
<li>Translate relative <code>*.md</code> links to point to the corresponding output directories</li>
<li>Compute relative link paths, with forward slashes only (Metalsmith only provides the source path by default)</li>
<li>A &quot;no-op&quot; plugin for conditional inclusion of plugins without breaking up the giant configuration chain</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>
<p>Here are a couple of snags I hit while integrating Metalsmith into my site.</p>
<h3 id="inflexible-directory-structure">Inflexible directory structure</h3>
<p>For how simple Metalsmith is, I figured it would allow for a flexible directory structure, but Metalsmith actually only allows a single source directory by default. This is a problem for my directory structure because I separated all of my content (Markdown files) from files needed to build the web site (scripts, templates, but also CSS). Fortunately, the <a href="https://github.com/TheHydroImpulse/metalsmith-static">metalsmith-static</a> plugin handle this scenario:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> assets = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;metalsmith-static&quot;</span>);

<span class="hljs-title class_">Metalsmith</span>
...
    .<span class="hljs-title function_">use</span>(<span class="hljs-title function_">assets</span>({
        <span class="hljs-attr">src</span>: <span class="hljs-string">&quot;static&quot;</span>,
        <span class="hljs-attr">dest</span>: <span class="hljs-string">&quot;.&quot;</span>,
    }))</code></pre>
<h3 id="destination-paths-arent-available">Destination paths aren&#39;t available</h3>
<p>Somewhere in Metalsmith&#39;s pipeline, it knows where a file is going to end up, but for some inexplicable reason, this information isn&#39;t available to templates or plugins. In my case, it&#39;s easy to infer the destination (although I had to deal with Windows&#39; annoying path-separating backslashes), so it wasn&#39;t a big deal, but this really isn&#39;t something I should have had to think about.</p>
<h3 id="plugin-ordering">Plugin ordering</h3>
<p>Since plugins enrich and mutate files and metadata along the way, the ordering of plugins matters. One annoying interaction was between the &quot;layouts&quot; (templating) and &quot;feed&quot; (RSS) plugins:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Feed&quot; then &quot;layouts&quot;: the RSS feed gets wrapped in HTML (&quot;layouts&quot; is run on <em>every</em> file by default)</li>
<li>&quot;Layouts&quot; then &quot;feed&quot;: the RSS content for each post is now a full HTML page, because templates were already applied</li>
</ul>
<p>The fix in this case was to run &quot;layouts&quot; after &quot;feed&quot; but tell &quot;layouts&quot; to only process HTML files (and not &quot;feed.xml&quot;).</p>
<p>This all makes sense if you think about how Metalsmith plugins receive a set of files, manipulate them, and then pass them on to the next plugin, but other generators do a good job of insulating me from mistakes like this.</p>
<h3 id="handling-internal-links">Handling internal links</h3>
<p>I&#39;m still surprised that using relative links to Markdown files for internal linking between posts isn&#39;t well supported by the static site generators I&#39;ve tried so far (Metalsmith included). I ended up having to extend the <a href="https://marked.js.org/using_pro#renderer">Marked renderer</a> to enable internal links:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> marked = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;marked&quot;</span>);
<span class="hljs-comment">// ...</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// Translate relative Markdown links to point to corresponding HTML output files</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> markdownRenderer = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> marked.<span class="hljs-title class_">Renderer</span>();
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> baseLinkRenderer = markdownRenderer.<span class="hljs-property">link</span>;
markdownRenderer.<span class="hljs-property">link</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params">href, title, text</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> baseLinkRenderer.<span class="hljs-title function_">call</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>,
        href.<span class="hljs-title function_">replace</span>(<span class="hljs-regexp">/^([^/][^:]*)\.md(#[^#]+)?$/</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;../$1/$2&quot;</span>),
        title,
        text);
};
<span class="hljs-comment">// ...</span>
<span class="hljs-title class_">Metalsmith</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// ...</span>
    .<span class="hljs-title function_">use</span>(<span class="hljs-title function_">markdown</span>({ <span class="hljs-attr">renderer</span>: markdownRenderer }))
    .<span class="hljs-title function_">use</span>(<span class="hljs-title function_">permalinks</span>())</code></pre>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I realized I also want to be able to link to a heading <em>within</em> another post (examples: <a href="#architecture">link to Architecture heading in this post</a>; <a href="../comparison/#metalsmith">link to my initial impression of Metalsmith in a different post</a>). The code above has been updated to handle this case.</p>
<h3 id="syntax-highlighting">Syntax highlighting</h3>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I added a <a href="../metalsmith-syntax-highlighting/">separate post on adding syntax highlighting</a>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, I really liked that Metalsmith just did exactly what I asked, even if I didn&#39;t initially know what, precisely, I wanted. I was able to find plugins for almost everything to get started (including local testing with live reloading). Importantly, I also feel like I fully understand what Metalsmith is doing, so I don&#39;t have to worry about later discovering that it was processing files multiple times (something that did happen with Eleventy).</p>
<p>Additionally, because Metalsmith is so simple to extend, I can actually foresee myself writing a plugin to, say, add inline diagrams that are automatically converted to SVG at build time (a feature that&#39;s part of my <a href="../overview/">my ideal workflow</a>).</p>
<p>One comment on Handlebars: this isn&#39;t a review of Handlebars, but I did find Handlebars to be a surprisingly agreeable template language. This is actually high praise coming from me, since I find most template languages to be hideous and verbose. Only annoyance is that the automatic indentation isn&#39;t always what you want (e.g. in the case of <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> blocks).</p>
<p>Overall, I&#39;m very happy with Metalsmith, and it&#39;s likely that I will be using it moving forward. <strong>Update</strong>: I switched from Eleventy to Metalsmith.</p>
