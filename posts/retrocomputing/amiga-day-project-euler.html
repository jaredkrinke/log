<p>Today is <strong><a href="https://www.lemonamiga.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=11833">International Amiga Day</a></strong>, when retrocomputing enthusiasts are required to boot up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga">fanciest multimedia computer line to ever fail</a>. I'm not really qualified to comment on the Amiga since the closest thing I'd used until recently was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">Commodore 64</a>, but I won't let such a trivial matter as <em>not being qualified</em> stop me from spewing uninformed opinions.</p>
<h1 id="amiga">Amiga</h1>
<p><strong>I recently acquired an Amiga 500 and I've been having some (mostly Type II) fun retrocomputing on it</strong>. For a platform that launched in the US around the same time as the original Nintendo Entertainment System, the Amiga is impressive! N.B. The Amiga <em>platform</em> launched with the Amiga 1000, but I'm using a later <em>model</em>--the Amiga 500.</p>
<p>Unlike the earlier Commodore 64, the Amiga shipped with a bridge to the future: an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-232">RS-232 serial port</a>. This enables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copying small files to/from a serial port-equipped modern computer (cf. <a href="https://ohse.de/uwe/software/lrzsz.html">lrzsz</a>)</li>
<li>Dialing into Internet-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">BBSes</a>, using a modem emulator (cf. <a href="https://github.com/go4retro/tcpser">tcpser</a>)</li>
<li>Controlling terminal-mode programs on Linux/BSD-based computers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>With a hard drive, I could theoretically even get on the web</strong>. Unfortunately, my Amiga 500 only has 1 MB of RAM and no hard drive, so I haven't gotten beyond single-floppy programs/games yet.</p>
<h2 id="amiga-basic">Amiga Basic</h2>
<p>But, of course, the most urgent task on my plate is to add another programming language to <a href="../100-languages/index.html">the pile</a>, and this brings me to <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_Basic">Amiga Basic</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Amiga Basic is included on the &quot;extras&quot; disk of Workbench 1.3 (which came with my A500). Similar to Commodore BASIC, it was written by Microsoft and, also similarly, I didn't enjoy it. Here are my notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>There aren't functions (other than single-line <code>DEF FN</code> statements which... didn't work)</li>
<li>It supports 32-bit arithmetic... except for <code>MOD</code> (ask me how I know)</li>
<li>The environment is impressively small at 80 KB</li>
<li>The <a href="https://archive.org/details/Amiga_BASIC_1985_Commodore">Amiga Basic manual </a> feels very dated--it spends a lot of time discussing UI that feels obvious to modern users, then moves onto &quot;advanced topics&quot;, and only covers everything else in a reference section</li>
<li>Thankfully, line numbers aren't required (as in Commodore BASIC)</li>
<li>The UI was fairly slow</li>
<li>The interpreter is annoyingly slow</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, I liked the older BBC BASIC better. <strong>And Turbo Pascal beats all BASICs handily!</strong></p>
<h2 id="looking-forward">Looking forward</h2>
<p>I'm not precisely sure how much time (and money) I'll spend investigating the Amiga, but I would really like to get a hard drive so that I sample the true Amiga <em>computer</em> experience (instead of the game console-esque experience I've had thus far).</p>
<p>If you have any pointers to Amiga resources (or any advice on what to do with an A500), <a href="mailto:log@schemescape.com">send me a mail</a>. Thanks!</p>
