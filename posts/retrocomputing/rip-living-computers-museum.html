<p>Given my interest in <a href="amiga-day-project-euler.html">old</a>, <a href="../programming-languages/minimal-dev-env-3.html">slow</a>, and <a href="../programming-languages/minimal-dev-env.html">minimalist</a> computers, it's unsurprising that I thoroughly enjoyed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Computers:_Museum_%2B_Labs">Living Computers Museum</a>. Not only I was able to relive my childhood of playing Marble Madness on a (real) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">Commodore 64</a>, it was the backdrop to my first experience with the vaunted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga">Amiga</a> platform. Astoundingly, it was also possible to toy around with ancient room-sized computers of yore.</p>
<p>Back in 2020, I was saddened to hear that the museum had <a href="https://seattlecollegian.com/paul-allens-living-computers-museum-remains-closed-after-years-despite-lifted-covid-restrictions/">closed its doors</a>, after the death of its benefactor, Paul Allen. Generously, they left many machines (and even a BBS) accessible over telnet. <strong>In fact, I had logged into the LCM telnet interface roughly one week ago.</strong></p>
<p>But recently it all went dark. The Living Computers Museum has <a href="https://hackaday.com/2024/06/25/paul-allens-living-computers-museum-and-labs-to-be-auctioned/">officially shut down for good and its artifacts are to be auctioned off</a>. The telnet service, and even the museum's web site, have all been unceremoniously taken offline. <strong>It's a sad day for vintage computing.</strong></p>
<p>I guess, for now, I will plan on continuing to run my own vintage hardware museum, however inefficient.</p>
