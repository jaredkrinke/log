<p>Browser-based games are great because players can pick them up and start playing without having to install anything (assuming reasonable cross-browser compatibility). HTML can also be convenient for UI, especially for laying out text (although handling CSS and rendering quirks can be frustrating).</p>
<p>Despite the benefits, I&#39;d like to port my most popular browser-based game to Steam, for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I want players to be able to sync their data across devices, without forcing them to create a new account (and without me having to host everything)</li>
<li>I want Steam&#39;s huge user base to be able to access my game (more for convenience than for exposure)</li>
<li>I might want to build on this experience in the future, for example, if I&#39;d like to sell a game</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="open-questions">Open questions</h1>
<p>I have no experience developing for or publishing on Steam, so I have a lot of questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which browser-to-native framework should I use (Electron, Tauri, WebView2, etc.)?</li>
<li>Does Steam have built-in support for browser-based titles? Are any of the above frameworks in the Steamworks Common Redistributables package?</li>
<li>Which platforms should I support?</li>
<li>What&#39;s required to take advantage of Steam&#39;s support for cloud saves/syncing?</li>
<li>How do I test Steam Cloud saves?</li>
<li>Is there any way to transition user information from the current web site to the Steam release?</li>
<li>Will it end up costing more than the advertised $100? Is there any way to bring that cost down?</li>
<li>Is it permissible to promote the Steam version of the game from its current web-based host?</li>
<li>What sort of analytics does Steam provide for game publishers?</li>
</ul>
<p>Answering these questions will take some time, but honestly I think I&#39;d regret not ever trying to port my game to Steam.</p>
