<p>Today, I bid farewell to my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_Inspiron_Mini_Series#Dell_Inspiron_Mini_(1018)">Dell Inspiron Mini 1018</a>.</p>
<h1 id="netbooks">Netbooks</h1>
<p><a href="https://hackaday.com/2020/06/04/netbooks-the-form-factor-time-forgot/">Netbooks enjoyed a meteoric rise and fall</a> in the late 2000s and early 2010s. Basically, they were minimally viable laptops that were maximally affordable. For anyone who wanted a cheapo laptop, they were great! Sure, they were slow, and cramped, and slow. But they were cheap!</p>
<p>Actually, that&#39;s not fair. Netbooks were slower than their contemporaries, but anything clocked over 1 GHz isn&#39;t &quot;slow&quot;. That still should be enough for most reasonable workloads, if not for bloat. But I digress.</p>
<h1 id="personal-history">Personal history</h1>
<p>I don&#39;t specifically recall when I picked up my netbook, but it was probably in 2010 or 2011. It came with a 1.66 GHz Intel Atom N455 processor, 1 GB of DDR3 RAM, and a spinning hard drive.</p>
<p>It came preloaded with Windows 7 Starter, which ran... adequately. I used the netbook on the couch and it was pleasant. Just imagine a clunky tablet with a keyboard and no touchscreen.</p>
<p>Then at some point, I realized that I didn&#39;t really need a laptop, so I loaned it to someone else for work.</p>
<h2 id="end-of-life">End of life</h2>
<p>Later, I recovered the device and I updated the operating system to Windows 10. Big mistake. Windows 10 performance on this device was abysmal. It took nearly one full minute to open a web browser. It turns out that a 1 GB of RAM is woefully insufficient for Windows 10. Instead of being pleasant, the device became frustrating. Oh well, I still didn&#39;t <em>really</em> need a laptop, so I stuck it in a closet and forgot about it.</p>
<p>That could have been the end.</p>
<h2 id="rebirth">Rebirth</h2>
<p>Eventually, 2023 rolled around, and <a href="../programming-languages/minimal-dev-env.html">I was pining for simpler times</a>. Why do we keep buying faster computers that mostly perform the same functions as their ancestors? (This was before Windows 11&#39;s TPM 2.0 requirement.) After experimenting with an original Raspberry Pi B (now <em>those</em> are slow!) I pulled the netbook back out of my closet and <a href="../programming-languages/minimal-dev-env-4.html">set it up as a minimal development environment</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike Windows 10, Linux scales down fairly nicely to moderately old hardware. Using Alpine Linux, I was able to setup a comfortable terminal-only development environment for C. Using the w3m browser, I was able to read <a href="https://gigamonkeys.com/book/">Practical Common Lisp</a> so that I could <a href="../programming-languages/learning-lisp-in-2023.html">test out REPL-driven programming in Lisp</a>. Almost all Common Lisp code I&#39;ve ever written was authored in Emacs on this junky old netbook--and it never felt slow!</p>
<h2 id="the-net">The Net</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, 1 GB of RAM isn&#39;t sufficient for browsing many modern web sites. As much as I enjoy terminal mode browsers, having proportional fonts, colors, and a mouse are convenient. Dillo and NetSurf can help, but many sites require JavaScript, and sandboxing the enormous JavaScript runtime is just no longer possible on a 1 GB device.</p>
<p>Despite being <em>built</em> to &quot;surf the net&quot;, most netbooks can&#39;t keep up with the modern web. I&#39;m not happy about this realization, but that doesn&#39;t make it any less true.</p>
<h2 id="last-gasp">Last gasp</h2>
<p>If there&#39;s one saving grace, it&#39;s that many netbooks were built with commodity parts that could theoretically be upgraded. In fact, my netbook could accept a solid-state drive and probably at least 4 GB of RAM. In my case, the hard drive and (single) RAM slot could be accessed by removing the plastic shell and the keyboard. Unfortunately, I learned that my particular netbook has a fickle memory slot: it will only accept &quot;full power&quot; DDR3 RAM--multiple &quot;low power&quot; RAM sticks I plugged in failed to work.</p>
<p>Sadly, numerous trial-and-error RAM surgeries appear to have loosened the keyboard&#39;s ribbon connection to the point that it seems unstable. It&#39;s a sad day, but I need to lay this netbook to rest.</p>
<h1 id="the-future">The future</h1>
<p>Are my netbook days over? Maybe not! At some unknown point in the past, I had acquired a second netbook: an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus_EeeBook">Asus EeeBook X205</a>. It&#39;s not upgradable, but it&#39;s already equipped with 2 GB of RAM. I&#39;m sure the puny 32 GB hard drive will become a problem at some point, but I&#39;m going to throw Linux on and see what happens--it&#39;s not like there&#39;s enough space to install Windows 10 updates anyway!</p>
<p>So there you go: my personal netbook history.</p>
